# Testkit reporter

## Scope

The report currently includes:

 - the number of skipped tests grouped by features
 - the number of skipped tests grouped by skip reason

## Install

Make sure to install a recent [Go](https://go.dev) version.

```shell
go install github.com/neo4j-drivers/testkit-reporter/cmd/testkit-reporter@latest
```

This installs the binary to `$(go env PATH)/bin`. Make sure this is exported in your standard path.

Note: you can replace `latest` with a specific Git tag.

## Run

The reporter reads from standard input.
